# <SpellCaster> 

## Welcome to SpellCaster! Where learning a new spellcaster in Amtgard is made easy. This app is meant to allow the user to be able to select one of our four classes and see the level they are and spells that go along with them. We built this app to help newer players and even our veteran players, learn spells without becoming overwhelmed with all the choices in a fun way! Personally trying to memorize every spell a class can execute is hard. This will let the user break down each level for our spellcasters and see what they need to learn at that time. Whether you want to learn Wizard, Bard, Healer or even Druid, you can level up each class seperately and bounce between them.
