# <SpellCaster> 

## Welcome to SpellCaster! Where learning a new spellcaster is made easy. This app is meant to allow Amtgarders, which is a group of larpers across the states, to be able to select one of the four caster classes. We built this app to help newer players and even our veteran players, learn spells without becoming overwhelmed with all the choices in a fun way! Personally trying to memorize every spell a class can execute is hard. This will let the user break down each level for our casters and see what they need to learn for their current level. Whether you want to learn Wizard, Bard, Healer or even Druid, you can level up each class seperately and bounce between them. 

## Installation- N/A

## Usage- Select a caster class. After selection start leveling up your stats and learning new spells for levels 1 through 6. Each list will break down what a spell does when clicked upon. If you choose you would like to use your XP points in a different class, you can simply hit the reset button and put them into something different.
